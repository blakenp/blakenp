My name is Blake Peterson and I am a passionate programmer who loves problem-solving, learning new algorithms and techniques, and AI research. I am currently a rising Master's student at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah.
## Current Projects
Below are some of the most interesting projects I am currently working on. This isn't all I am up to, but these are the ones I find most interesting. You can check out more of my projects on my website at [blakenp.com](https://blakenp.com/).
### Codenames
I am currently working as a researcher at BYU on a project helping AI agents learn to make intelligent decisions in the language game *Codenames*. We use vector embeddings and cosine distance to demonstrate AI's effectiveness in this game, and the bot Spymaster leverages learned embeddings to generate clues, guiding both human and bot players in identifying their team's spies.
### Competitive Programming Tutor
Another project I am currently working on is a website that will use an LLM backed up with RAG to answer questions about competitive programming topics. The idea is to have a good tutor for preparing for coding competitions and technical interviews. I think this is really important since a lot of people look for more ways to practice, and I really enjoy competitive programming and learning and understanding more about algorithms used in coding competitions. I'm super excited about this one and am having fun with it.
## What I am Currently Learning
As previously mentioned, I am currently pursuing a Master's of Science degree at BYU and hope to learn more about Deep Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory concepts as these are the areas in AI research I am most interested in at the moment. I have already had a decent amount of experience with Computer Vision, and would like to dive deeper into Reinforcement Learning as I am interested in running realistic simulations to model the real world and possibly apply solutions to the real world with trained AI agents that could be applied to robotics and other fields. I also hope to earn a PhD after earning my Master's degree.
## Fun Facts
- I love Ecuadorian Food and Ice cream! 🍲🍦
- I am pretty good at playing Lucas in Super Smash Bros and generally enjoy Nintendo games. 🎮
- I lived in Los Angeles, California for 2 years serving a mission for my church. 👔
- I can dance bachata and salsa. While I am not the best at it, I bet you haven't met too many computer scientists from the United States that can claim this. 🕺
